# Week 1 1/28

## My thoughts on open source

I think open source is about the principles of freedom and that knowledge (in this particular case software) should be freely avaiable to all. Open source is a communtity where groups of individuals contribute to something that can become greater than the sum of its parts, and it's really amazing what has been created thanks to many people's passion. Advantages of open source is that it inspires contribution and creates a larger communitity sorrunding software, and vulnerabilities can be caught quicker due to the amount of eyes on the software. Problems are that because it's mostly volunteer work, sometimes projects can stagnate or be straight out abandoned. I've wanted to try contributing to open source, but I haven't gotten to do it. So hopefully this class will force me to do it. 

## Open source projects I use

My primary browser is firefox, and I switched to it from chrome a few years ago. I frequently use vlc for watching videos and audacity for audio editing. When I fell down the linux rabbit hole last year, I frequently used dwm as my windows manager of choice. Using linux and usings the hosts of open source software that exsist on it made me appreciate the power of open source.
