# TidePool and the power of open source

## Spirit of Tidepool
- Tidepool is an open source company that operates under the model that many of its contrbutors are people with diabetes, helping to building something that they can also benefit from
- Therefore there is an inherete openess and transparency they use in their business model, allowing them to develop software for the good of others
- Data is contributed voluntarily by patients, and therefore it's easy for the company to remain HIPPA compliant and there are no data concerns

## TidePool vs a Traditional Software Comapny
- Open source development is integral to the identity of TidePool, it is both the company's workflow as their as their ideology
- Tidepool benefits greatly from the open source workflow, as they can source data from the globe as well as software engineers from the world as well 
- This allows them to leverage the global consicousness, and allows for better development over all


# Group Work

## Individual Challenges
- Some of our individual challenges are that while we are great at working on issues by ourselves, we aren't very productive in a group setting
- We've attempted to work on an issue together, but some of the members aren't as familiar with git as others, therefore it was hard for them to adapt to this new workstyle


## Group Challenges
- Find issues to work on has been kind of tough for us, the p5.js project is quite slow and there isn't alot of momentum in the project
- We joined at kind of a bad time, because it seems there focused on gathering new features for their big update, which will start to be implemented in may
- This poses some challenges because while we have many pull requests made, it is unclear if they will get reviewed due to the lack of activity currently
