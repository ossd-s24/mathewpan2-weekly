# Open source technologies in Industry

## The adoption of open source or inner source in industry

- Companies had an adverse relationship with open source, but microsoft in 2014 claim to love open source, and it was a big shift in the industry 
- Going to an inner source workflow seems to be an approach that companies are taking to modernize their workflow and to gain the benefits of the open source workstyle on their proprietary code
- inner source heps to dismantle silos, redue engineering bottlenecks, improve the quaility of code

## Why to open source projects within companies
- Open sourcing codes forces engineer to better their code and include documentation
- It seems that opening up code to scrunity and increasing visiblity can be a big wake up call for engineers and help them level up their coding ability 
- For improving engineers, opening code up seems to help people be more confident in the quaility of their code, and also teaches them to be humble in order to be open to critisim 
- The nature of open source also helps to improve the communication between engineers

## Thoughts before open sourcing a project
- Open sourcing a project is a one all solution, thought needs to be put in if open sourcing is only reasonable if you need to bring in external vendors to the project
- There will be legal licensing regulations that need to be considered as well


## Group Progress on Open Source

- Our group have been contributing to the communtity by working on issues and particpating in the disscussion of bugs and new features
- So far, we've been waiting to be assigned on certain issues before we make pull requests, but we've already made great progress on a few issues
- There have been no major successes, though we seem to have missed the date for applying to be a steward (would give us more autonomy in dealing with projects)
- Biggest blocker so far is getting responses back, with the refactor going on, I think many of the people in charge are quite busy
- We've made 2 pull requests so far to issues that have been assigned to us, the requests are getting reviewed but it seems to be taking time as things move quite slowly with this project
- We've also made a proposal for the website, encouraging the improvement of keyboard navigation by allowing custom shortcuts
- I'm working towards fixing another bug with the program
