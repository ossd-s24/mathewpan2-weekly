# p5.js progress report

## The weekly meetings

- We had our first official out-of-class meeting this week, after an mostly chat based meeting last week
- There was a focus to familarize ourself with the codebase, as well as help with any setup issues any members had, along with helping one of our members who is not as familiar with js

## Accomplishments
- All members were able to get the development environment setup and running, and we compiled a short list of issues to be worked on 
- Members are now familiar with using p5.js, and understand which parts of code influence what parts of the project (to an extent, we are still new)
