## The weekly meetings

- We decided to meet for a short meeting during spring break since most of us had plans
- There was a talk about our future plans for the project, and specific points each of us were interesting in working on
- There was a group decision to try and work on the RFC 2.0 refactoring that's going on, and we were excited to begin on it the week after spring break
- Members also began to claim issues and begin working on them
