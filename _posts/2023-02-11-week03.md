# Git

## In class excerises
I am familiar with git and have used it a decent amount in the past, so nothing displayed in the class was new to me. Though I pretty much only interact with git through the gui provided by vscode, so it was interesting to learn the actual commands that gets run behind the scenes. Merge errors are always a nightmare, and having to resolve them is defintely the most annoying thing behind source control.

## In class browser extension
We were all quite busy this weekend, so not much progress have been made on the extension. So far we have agreed on the technologies and the basic functionality of our extension. We picked something simple and I also have experience building extensions, so I'm confident we can build it quickly on monday. 

## My contributions
I have created a react project and committed that so we have the base to do further work on.
