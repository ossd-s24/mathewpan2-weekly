# Class Disscussion

## Open Source Ideals
- Open source often runs parallel with things like free knowledge, so it comes as no suprise to me that there are many other places that also chooses to employ the same philosophy
- I think it's fun to have all these different projects that are built upon communitity support, it's really a great way to bring people together
 <!--more-->
 - I learned about a lot of different projects that I have never heard of before, and it was really interesting to learn the different ways they all choose to employ open source

 ## Interesting Projects
 - ```Precious Plastic```- I thought this project was quite interesting, and is a cool way to encourage people to recycle their trash
 - ```Dungeons and Dragons```- Definetly something that suprised me, but makes sense when you think about it. Homebrewed campigns has been a long time tenant of the franchise, and I never made the connection between it and open source. 
 - ```Opensource Hardware```- Opensourcing hardware is really something that should be made standard. There was the whole spectactle with Apple and them not releasing blueprints in an effort to make it difficult for 3rd party vendors to repair their devices. I think the Right to Repair act that was passed a few years ago is a step in the right direction.

 # Group project

 ## Current Progress

 - We made the slides over the weekend, as well as rehersed our presentation 
 - We are still trying to particpate in the community by answering issues and searching for small contributions that we can do 
 - So far, we have 4 merges, and a few more PRs that are just floating (under review or awaitting changes to be made)

## Individual Progress

- I currently have 2 prs under review, and have recieved feedback for the both of them
- I have worked on the improvements that they have asked for and resubmitted the prs for approval 
- It's unlikely for them to get merged before the presentation, but I will see these merges through during my own time
