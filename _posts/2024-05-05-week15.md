# Notable Group Presentation

## Spicetify 
- Really loved their presentation, it was clear they practiced well and their slides were very visually pleasing to look at
- I think they had really great contributions, but especially because their contributions were very presentable: the themes they made and all the changes they did was very visual 
- Very strong group with a great presentation!

## Godot
- I think this group also did a great job, and also really highlighted important parts about how it's important to align yourself with the maintainer's values 
- I know godot is a very difficult project to contribute to (espically the core part of it), but I think it's cool that they were still able to do so much
- They had a great presentation too, and I was suprised that they had actually gone to a game dev convention in California and meet one of the creators of Godot

## Gitlab
- It was great to hear them talk about how their first project was a dud, but they were able to transition to a different project that worked far better
- Honestly, from listening to their presentation, it sounds like gitlab is a really amazing project to contribute to, and makes me feel a little envious about how easy they made the process sound


# Our Group 


## Presentation
- We had our presentation on Wednesday, and while I'm overall happy with our group's progress, I do wish we could've gotten a few more coding contributions in than we did
- I think everyone spoke quite well during our presentation, and everyone was able to do well thanks to the many practice runs we did that week 
- I think our slides were lacking a bit in the visual department, but I hope that we were able to convey our points well enough 


## Contributions and the future?
- Like I mentioned in class, I'm probably gonna continue to follow my current 2 active PRs through, but I'm still unsure about contributing to the project in the future 
- I think the project overall was a solid choice, we got a bit unlucky with the timing of the project, and that kind of slowed down our progress
- I would choose this project again, though after hearing gitlab's presentation, maybe I would've chosen that instead.
