# Class Disscussion

## My Choice of Quote
- I chose the quote ```"Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)".```
- This quote is very interesting to me because I do believe that coding everything from scratch is not nesscearry, since anything you want to built probably already exists in some form on the internet already
- Truly being able to understand code and to be able to develop an inutition on what code you can use as a base is a very useful skill to have 
- I think with the introduction of ai and the many different llms that have been popping up, the ability of coders to focus on rewriting becomes more important than ever

## Thoughts after the Dissucssion

- the quote ```"Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow."``` really resonated with me since this is a lesson I learned very well when I was first learning the SOLID principles for programming
- I was trying to implement and follow the principles like gospel, and it ended up with me writing far more complex code that really was nessceary for the application that I was builing 
- It really taught me that there isn't a catch all rule for writing code, other than writing clear and well documented code of course
- My favorite quote after the disscussion is ```"Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away."```. I really like the message it tries to convey, and how simplicity is often overlooked in software design.
- That quote specifically reminds me of another quote: ```"An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity"```


# Group Progress

## Group Challenges

- We are still struggling with responses when it comes to issues that are not sorrunding documentation (our only merge)
- I think we are trying to pivot by targeting issues under the management of the more active members of the communtity, as documentation PRs are merged very swiftly
- We want to try to come up with proposals to improve p5.js in their refactor, but our inexperience in using the software is hindering this

## Individual Challenges

- Some of the issues regarding webgl have been giving me a lot of trouble to figure out, and it's been a lot harder to impelement fixes for them compared to the issues that I have been working on
- I also thinK I should try to particpate in the community more in other ways that are not just code contributions, and should try to actively engage in the comunity more
