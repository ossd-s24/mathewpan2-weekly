# Extension project after-thoughts

## Working With Others

* I think that working with others in a repository always involve a little more care to avoid merge conflicts or worse: committing without pulling first
* I think I work fine in a group, and I do perfer working through pull requests instead of direct commits. It makes my heart more at peace to make pull requests when working with multiple people. 
* Communication is always an obstacle when working with others, but my group made good time to meet and were all very pleasant to work with

## My Own Contributions
* So I expanded on the fetch script one of my other group members wrote
* It was a bit overkill but I did use react in the extension rather than raw javascript, because I had made a extension using it before so + I'm more familiar with that technology (my work perferred it as well)
* I was already familiar with making extensions, so I was pretty familiar with everything that was used
* Working with git and that kind of workflow of contributing through pull request is something I had to go through when taking agile, so that didn't feel strange
* I've been forgetting to click pull before I push because I've mostly been working on personal projects recently, so I'm glad I had this refresher to remind me of keeping good git habits

## My favorite extension
* studyTool was my favorite extension by far 
* I liked how they handled the tiling of the windows, as well as the idea and execution of the extension
* They also did a great job on their presentation and make their extension very memorable
